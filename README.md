# EmployeeAttrition
A machine learning project done by my groupmates and I in R Programming Language, where we attempt to predict whether an employee would attrite or otherwise.

My contributions in this project were training various decision tree ensembles, i.e. Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Bagged Trees.
